# Backend Project with NodeJS

This project's been created to simulate an ecommerce created with NodeJs for Coderhouse's project.

### Steps to make the project work:

- Clone the product, using the command line and typing: git clone "path of the project"
- Once the product is already cloned, drag and drop the folder to Visual studio code.
- With the project opened in VSC, open a new command line, go to the path of your current project and to be able to use node packages for this project, just hit: npm install

ItÂ´s as easy as that.
